# password-generator

This is the homework for week three. Client wants us to create an application that enables employees to create random passwords based on criteria they've selected.

This application should include a prompt, make the user make a selection between 8-128 characters, and generate a random password using a mixture of upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters.
